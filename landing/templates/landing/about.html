  <p class="text-center m-5">This Django Blog hopefully will develope into a blog that people can discuss Python and
    Django. HTML, CSS and JavaScript as well. This Blog was built with bootstrap 4 but I think I would like to try and
    do regular HTML and CSS on my next project. CSS grid templates looked like a great way to do layouts for a project.
    Currently I have no vanilla JS built into this project but when I figure out where to squeeze it in I plan to do
    just that.</p>
